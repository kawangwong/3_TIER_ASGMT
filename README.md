For this learner, the goal will be utilizing SG as the foundation to creating safeguards in egress and ingress of traffic, the use of CA certs for the purpose of creating secure encrypted traffic to prevent snooping and to increase availability of service through the use of availability using application load balancing services provided on AWS.
